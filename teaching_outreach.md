# Outreach

Some of my past outreach focused on Sonar Education and Exploration (project SEE). With a great team, we got funded, designed, built and coded, and presented a hands-on experience for students to create their own miniature sonar research cruises over a range of seafloor features. See two different versions of the project in the publications below or snag all the source files to create your own version [here](https://github.com/UHGS/Project_SEE "here").

I've also been involved with contributing to outreach blogs at sea, open houses, and Nerd Nite.
