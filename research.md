I use marine geophysics to study how the Earth's tectonic plates form, bend, break, subside, and slide past each other. I'm interested in the large-scale processes that shape the Earth's crust and upper mantle, and how these processes affect people, leading much of my research to focus on the complex interactions that occur at plate boundaries. I mainly focus on acquiring, processing, and interpreting seismic reflection data but will utilize a variety of geophysical techniques to further increase our understanding of the tectonic setting. 



## Continental Rifting and Breakup

Rifted continental margins are one of the longest tectonic features on Earth, with the process of continental breakup being fundamental to plate tectonics and the formation of new ocean basins.

##### Zealandia

Located in the SW Pacific, Zealandia has been refered to as the "Hidden Continent" since ~94% of it is submerged beneath the ocean. During Cretaceous, eastern Gondwana started continental rifting and breakup to separate northern Zealandia from eastern Australia. Due to this remote location, little work has been done to understand the structure and breakup of the margin. I sailed on the R/V _Kairei_ as part of a multi-leg survey to collect seismic reflection data and wide-angle seismic data to study this unique continental endmember.

## Hawaiian-Emperor Seamount Chain

Starting at the Big Island of Hawaii and extending to the Aleutian Trench, the Hawaiian-Emperor Seamount Chain is a classic example of a hotspot seamount chain. Check out the [blog](https://hawaiiemperor.blogspot.com "blog") for information on a recent seismic cruise series using R/V _Marcus G. Langseth_ and stay tuned for future publications.

A previous sonar cruise on the Hawaiian Ridge up to just NW of Kure and Midway Atolls mapped 19 seamounts and discovered deep guyots, likely old preexisting Cretaceous seamounts, intertwined with ones from the Hawaiian Chain.

## Subduction Zones

These regions where plates collide produce some of the largest earthquakes, create huge tsunamis, and contained highly deformed belts of rock. My work on subduction zones has covered a range of settings, from the incoming plate to the inner accretionary prism and overlying forearc basin.
##### Japan Trench
The great 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku-oki earthquake at the Japan Trench produced huge co-seismic slip and created the tsunami that devastated much of northeast Japan. I sailed on a rapid-response cruise led by JAMSTEC soon after the earthquake to collect seismic data along this margin.

##### Nankai Trough

Due to its potential for great earthquakes, this margin has a tremendous amount of work to study earthquake and subduction zone processes. My work has used the Kumano 3D seismic volume, and I sailed on D/V _Chikyu_ to drill deep into the inner accretionary prism.
