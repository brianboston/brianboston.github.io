My research is focused on using geophysical methods to study tectonics, volcanism, basin systems, and geologic hazards. I utilize controlled-source seismology along with other geophysical and geological data to investigate deformation at subduction zones and continental rifted margins. If you're interested in working with me as a graduate student (MS/PhD) or postdoctoral researcher, feel free to reach out to me by email to discuss future opportunities.
