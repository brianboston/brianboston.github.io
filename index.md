My research is focused on using geophysical methods to study tectonics, volcanism, basin systems, and geologic hazards. I utilize active-source seismology along with other geophysical and geological data to investigate deformation at subduction zones and continental rifted margins.

I will moving to Auburn University this fall 2022 as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Geosciences. If you're interested in working with me as a graduate student (MS/PhD) or postdoctoral researcher, feel free to reach out to me by email to discuss future opportunities.
